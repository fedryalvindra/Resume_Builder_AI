## Background
Many people struggle to create a good cv, especially when they are new to the job market or changing careers. They spend hours working on their cv/resumes, but often get ignored by employers because their cv/resumes aren’t clear, well-organized, or don’t have the right keywords to pass company filters.

To solve this problem, we decided to create an AI Resume Builder. This tool helps job seekers easily make a professional resume by giving smart suggestions and making sure it looks great. The goal is to help people stand out and increase their chances of getting their dream job.
